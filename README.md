# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**A quantitative model of gastric smooth muscle cellular activation.**   
Corrias A, Buist ML. _Ann Biomed Eng_ 2007 Sep;35(9):1595-607
[17486452](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17486452) ,  
**Abstract:**   
A physiologically realistic quantitative description of the electrical
behavior of a gastric smooth muscle (SM) cell is presented. The model
describes the response of a SM cell when activated by an electrical stimulus
coming from the network of interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and is mediated
by the activation of different ion channels species in the plasma membrane.
The conductances (predominantly Ca2+ and K+) that are believed to
substantially contribute to the membrane potential fluctuations during slow
wave activity have been included in the model. A phenomenological description
of intracellular Ca2+ dynamics has also been included because of its primary
importance in regulating a number of cellular processes. In terms of shape,
duration, and amplitude, the resulting simulated smooth muscle depolarizations
(SMDs) are in good agreement with experimentally recordings from mammalian
gastric SM in control and altered conditions. This model has also been
designed to be suitable for incorporation into large scale multicellular
simulations.
